# Maintainer release and deployment guide

This guide is for maintainers publishing official Local Notion releases and Docker images. For installation and everyday use, see the [main README](../README.md) and [Docker user guide](../docker/README.md). The scripts and version settings are also available in **Other > Build and Release** in Visual Studio.

**You explicitly choose when to release and which version to publish.** Ordinary commits, branch pushes, pull-request merges, local builds, and edits to `Version.props` do not publish a release.

Publication starts when a maintainer pushes a `v*` release tag (normally through the release command below), or explicitly runs the build workflow with **publish enabled** on the official default branch. After that choice, successful tests lead to automatic publication; there is no second manual approval prompt.

## Checklist for your next release

1. **Prepare the source.** Review and test your changes, include the latest `master` changes, and commit everything intended for the release. Open PowerShell 7 in the official repository root. Run `git status --short`; it must show no pending changes or untracked files before releasing.
2. **Choose an unused version.** For example, use `1.5.1` for the next patch release or `1.6.0` for the next minor release. Replace `1.5.1` below with your chosen version. The release command updates `Version.props` for you.
3. **Preview the release action:**

   ```powershell
   .\build\release.ps1 -Version 1.5.1 -WhatIf
   ```

   Review the proposed version, commit, and tag. This checks the release plan and may fetch remote branch information; it does not build, edit files, commit, tag, or push. For a full CI rehearsal, use [Run workflow](https://github.com/Sphere10/LocalNotion/actions/workflows/release.yml) with **publish disabled** and wait for the tests to pass.

4. **When ready, start publishing:**

   ```powershell
   .\build\release.ps1 -Version 1.5.1
   ```

   This updates and commits `Version.props` when necessary, then pushes the current committed source to `master` together with the `v1.5.1` tag. GitHub Actions builds and tests all native packages and Docker before uploading the release assets.

5. **Wait for completion.** Follow the Actions link printed by the command. A pushed tag means publishing has started; confirm the workflow succeeds and the version appears in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Sphere10/LocalNotion/releases). Newer stable releases also update the official Docker `latest` tag.
6. **If a run fails, check its logs.** Follow the [retry and recovery instructions](#recover-publication-after-a-publisher-fix). Preserve existing release tags and published assets; use a new version for changed binaries.

The build system lives in this repository. It does not require `Y:\builds`, the old SP10 PowerShell module, external attachment folders, signing certificates, or developer-machine paths. Build outputs, temporary packaging directories, and smoke-test extractions are kept under the Git-ignored `publish/` directory.

## Requirements

Use the .NET 10 SDK selected by [global.json](../global.json), Git, and PowerShell **7.4 or later** for packaging and CI helpers. The release entry point requires PowerShell 7 or later; use 7.4 for the complete toolchain. Docker Desktop or Docker Engine is needed for Docker builds and image checks. The local release command requires authenticated Git push access to the official repository. GitHub Actions supplies GitHub CLI and its own token for the publishing job; you do not need to install GitHub CLI locally.

The .NET 10 upgrade uses SDK **10.0.400**, selected by global.json, and runtime **10.0.11**. CLI, Core, and Renderer target net10.0; the vendored Notion.Client retains netstandard2.0 compatibility. SDK and runtime version numbers are separate. Docker builds use the matching SDK image and the official .NET 10 runtime-deps images based on Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble). These runtime images support ARM32, so the linux-arm archive smoke test and all eight native release targets remain supported.

The native Windows archive installer is a separate end-user script compatible with Windows PowerShell **5.1**. Users do not need the .NET SDK to run self-contained native archives or the Windows Docker launcher bundle.

## Version and build number

[Version.props](../Version.props) is the shared source for the CLI, Core, and Renderer release version, currently `1.6.0`. [Directory.Build.props](../Directory.Build.props) and [Directory.Build.targets](../Directory.Build.targets) derive the application version fields from that value. The vendored `Notion.Client` keeps its upstream package version.

For version `1.5.0`, build number `17`, and commit `<commit>`:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Version` and `PackageVersion` | `1.5.0` |
| `AssemblyVersion` and `FileVersion` | `1.5.0.17` |
| `InformationalVersion` and CLI `--version` identity | `1.5.0+build.17.sha.<commit>` |
| Native archive `VERSION.txt` | `1.5.0-build.17` |

Prereleases retain their suffix in the release and informational versions; assembly/file versions use the numeric release components. The commit suffix is included when source control information is available. Packaging resolves Git HEAD unless `-SourceRevisionId` is supplied explicitly.

Normal local and Visual Studio builds use build number **0**. Compiling does not edit a counter or increment the version. CI resolves `github.run_number` once in the metadata job and passes the same version, number, and commit to every native package, Docker image, and launcher bundle.

The workflow run number increases for each new run of this workflow. Pull-request and preview runs consume numbers too, so published release build numbers can have gaps. Rerunning jobs in the same workflow run keeps that run number; a new dispatch starts a new number. This is a workflow counter, not a counter of successful releases.

The build number and each numeric release component must be **0–65534** to fit assembly metadata. The scripts and MSBuild targets explicitly fail above that limit; they never wrap or silently reset the number. A maintainer must choose and implement a new counter policy before the workflow reaches the limit.

## Package locally

From the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
./build/package.ps1 -Runtime win-x64
```

This uses the version in `Version.props`, build `0`, and Git HEAD. The archive is written to `publish/<version>/artifacts/localnotion-win-x64.zip`. To supply a build identity and output directory explicitly:

```powershell
$commit = (git rev-parse HEAD).Trim()
./build/package.ps1 -Runtime linux-x64 -Version 1.5.0 -BuildNumber 17 -SourceRevisionId $commit -OutputDirectory ./publish/example/artifacts
```

The script publishes the complete self-contained `net10.0` output, includes native dependencies, then adds the platform installer, README, repository `LICENSE`, `COPYRIGHT` and `COPYING.EXCEPTION`, `VERSION.txt`, and `localnotion-release.json`. LocalNotion remains GPL-licensed; Sphere10.VisualRenderer and other dependencies retain their separate licenses and notices. Preserve the renderer notices copied by its NuGet package in the published output. The [linking exception](../COPYING.EXCEPTION) covers only copyrights the named Grantors own or are authorized to license; any additional rights required from other contributors or third-party suppliers must be resolved before release. No old proprietary EULA, credentials, or private Docker state is copied. Repackaging a RID into the same local output directory replaces its archive.

To package all supported RIDs locally:

```powershell
$platforms = Get-Content ./build/platforms.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
foreach ($platform in $platforms.include) {
    ./build/package.ps1 -Runtime $platform.rid
}
```

Windows compatibility wrappers `publish-all.bat`, `publish-win-x64.bat`, and `publish-linux-x64.bat` call this same script and forward packaging options. They produce local files; they do not publish a release.

### Renderer package dependency

LocalNotion restores the pinned Sphere10.VisualRenderer binary NuGet package.
Its source, tests, versioning, and pack/publish scripts belong to Sphere10
Commercial. This workflow does not build or publish the renderer.

Make the pinned package available to the developer/CI NuGet sources before
building a LocalNotion release. See [renderer integration](../docs/renderer.md).
The renderer's version changes independently of LocalNotion's release version.

### Validate an archive

Run the smoke test on a host that can execute the packaged RID. For a local Windows x64 package of version 1.5.0:

```powershell
$commit = (git rev-parse HEAD).Trim()
./build/test-package.ps1 -ArchivePath ./publish/1.5.0/artifacts/localnotion-win-x64.zip -Runtime win-x64 -Version 1.5.0 -BuildNumber 0 -SourceRevisionId $commit
```

The helper validates the extracted metadata and executable, then checks the CLI version and help output. Default extraction uses a unique directory under `publish/.smoke` and is cleaned afterward. `-SkipExecution` checks archive structure and identity when the local host cannot execute its RID. `-ExtractDirectory` requires a new directory and keeps the extraction for external checks. Neither option installs the application.

To retain an existing Windows command bootstrap while using an installed native executable, configure `docker/install-cli.ps1 -NativeExecutable <absolute-executable-path> -NoPath`. The native package must already be deployed. The bootstrap preserves its Docker configuration and supports `LOCALNOTION_BACKEND=docker` for comparison tests; see [native bootstrap setup](../docker/README.md#use-the-existing-command-bootstrap-with-a-native-windows-executable).

### Docker and its Windows installer bundle

Build a local versioned Docker candidate:

```powershell
$commit = (git rev-parse HEAD).Trim()
docker build --platform linux/amd64 --build-arg VERSION=1.5.0 --build-arg BUILD_NUMBER=0 --build-arg "VCS_REF=$commit" -t local-notion:1.5.0 .
docker run --rm --network none local-notion:1.5.0 --version
```

Package the standalone Windows Docker launcher installer:

```powershell
./build/package-docker-launcher.ps1 -Version 1.5.0 -BuildNumber 0 -SourceRevisionId $commit
```

The bundle contains only the launcher source/scripts, installer entry points, README, license notices, and release metadata. Its root `install.ps1` pulls `ghcr.io/sphere10/local-notion:<version>`, verifies the image is available, then calls the bundled launcher installer with that image selected. It supports `-InstallDirectory` and `-NoPath`; a repository checkout is not required. It compiles the small Windows launcher inside the extracted bundle, so extraction must be in a writable directory. The Docker image itself is downloaded from GHCR and is not embedded in the ZIP.

## Platforms and release assets

[platforms.json](platforms.json) supplies the workflow matrix:

| RID | CI runner | Archive | Execution check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `win-x64` | `windows-latest` | `localnotion-win-x64.zip` | Windows x64 |
| `win-x86` | `windows-latest` | `localnotion-win-x86.zip` | Windows x86 |
| `win-arm64` | `windows-11-arm` | `localnotion-win-arm64.zip` | Windows ARM64 |
| `linux-x64` | `ubuntu-24.04` | `localnotion-linux-x64.tar.gz` | Linux x64 |
| `linux-arm64` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | `localnotion-linux-arm64.tar.gz` | Linux ARM64 |
| `linux-arm` | `ubuntu-24.04` | `localnotion-linux-arm.tar.gz` | ARM32 under QEMU |
| `osx-x64` | `macos-15-intel` | `localnotion-osx-x64.tar.gz` | macOS Intel |
| `osx-arm64` | `macos-15` | `localnotion-osx-arm64.tar.gz` | macOS Apple Silicon |

The ARM32 job first checks the archive without executing it, then runs the extracted executable in a `linux/arm/v7` .NET runtime-dependencies container under QEMU and verifies its full version identity. Other matrix jobs run their packaged executables directly. Windows x64 and Linux x64 also run the repository-path regression. Docker is built for `linux/amd64` and checked for version, help, and Git ownership behavior before its exact tested image is saved for publication.

Each published release contains these eight native archives plus:

- `localnotion-docker-windows.zip`: the standalone Windows Docker launcher installer.
- `release.json`: version, build, commit, image identity, and archive names, sizes, and SHA-256 values.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`: checksums for the nine archives and `release.json`.

Asset names remain stable across releases. URLs under `https://github.com/Sphere10/LocalNotion/releases/latest/download/` therefore follow the current stable release. Select a specific release page when an exact version is required.

Native archives support portable use with all extracted files kept together. Windows `install.bat`/`install.ps1` can install under the current user's profile and update only user PATH; `-NoPath` skips PATH changes. Unix `install.sh` stores versions under the chosen prefix and manages its `localnotion` symlink. Both retain older version directories. Unix tar archives preserve executable permissions. These builds are unsigned; macOS builds are not notarized.

## How the CI/CD pipeline runs

The [release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) has four stages:

1. **Resolve metadata.** The metadata job reads `Version.props`, checks the requested version or tag, resolves the exact commit, and assigns the workflow run number. It supplies one immutable identity and the matrix from `platforms.json` to all downstream jobs.
2. **Build in parallel.** Eight native jobs publish and archive the CLI for their RIDs while the Docker job builds the `linux/amd64` image and Windows launcher bundle. Each job receives the same version, build number, and commit.
3. **Test the deliverables.** Native jobs extract their archives and check metadata and execution; ARM32 runs under QEMU. Docker checks the candidate's version/help and Git ownership behavior. The workflow uploads all nine archive artifacts and saves the exact tested Docker image. A failed matrix or Docker check prevents the release job from running.
4. **Publish after validation.** For a publishing run, the release job downloads those outputs, validates the archives and saved image, and creates or resumes a matching draft. It uploads the artifacts and metadata, pushes the matching versioned Docker image, and verifies anonymous registry access before making the release public. Only a newer stable version can update both GitHub's latest selection and Docker `latest`. If publisher code needs a fix after the build jobs passed, the recovery workflow below can run the fixed publisher against the original outputs and build identity.

### Triggers

| Trigger | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Pull request changing workflow, build, Docker, or application files | Build and test; upload preview artifacts; no publication |
| Manual **Run workflow**, `publish: false` | Build and test the selected ref; optional version override; no publication |
| Push of a `v*` tag | Publish only in `Sphere10/LocalNotion`, with a matching `Version.props` and a commit on the official default branch |
| Manual **Run workflow**, `publish: true` | Publication is allowed only in `Sphere10/LocalNotion` from its default branch; the version and existing-release checks still apply |
| Manual **Retry release publication** on the default branch | Validate a successful tagged build's original run ID and publish its saved outputs with the current publisher; no rebuild or retag |

The normal release entry point below creates and pushes the tag that triggers automatic publication. The manually dispatched preview is useful before that tag exists.

### Permissions and registry setup

The local release helper uses your existing Git authentication to push to the official origin. Its atomic push needs permission to update master and create the release tag; repository branch/tag protection can reject it. No Notion integration credential is used by any build or release check.

Workflow jobs start with `contents: read`. Only the final release job requests `contents: write` for GitHub releases and `packages: write` for GHCR. It passes GitHub's automatic token as `GH_TOKEN` to GitHub CLI and authenticates Docker to `ghcr.io` using that same token. Do not add a personal access token or signing certificate to package files. Organization Actions policy must permit the workflow and these requested token permissions.

If the GHCR package already exists, its settings must allow this repository's workflow to write to it, either through inherited repository permissions or explicit **Manage Actions access**. For anonymous downloads, an organization owner must also make the package **Public**. A public repository alone does not change package visibility. See the [registry setup instructions](#public-container-registry-access).

### Logs, artifacts, and failures

Open [Actions → Build and release Local Notion](https://github.com/Sphere10/LocalNotion/actions/workflows/release.yml). The run title includes its build number. Open a failed job and step to see validation output; native jobs are named `Package <rid>`. Successful preview outputs appear in the run's **Artifacts** list, including `native-<rid>`, `docker-launcher`. Published downloads and notes appear on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Sphere10/LocalNotion/releases).

Native and launcher workflow artifacts are retained for seven days; the saved tested Docker image is retained for one day. Retry failed publication jobs promptly in the same run so the exact tested outputs remain available. Fix a build/test failure before creating a new publishing attempt. If publication already created a draft, follow the identity and retry rules below; an expired or changed artifact is not permission to overwrite a release with rebuilt bytes.

## Preview the workflow

Open [Build and release Local Notion](https://github.com/Sphere10/LocalNotion/actions/workflows/release.yml), choose **Run workflow**, select the intended ref, and leave **publish** set to **false**. Leave **version** blank to use `Version.props`, or supply a preview version.

The preview builds and checks every package and the Docker candidate, and uploads workflow artifacts. It does not publish a GitHub release, push a container image, or update `latest`. Pull requests affecting the workflow, build system, Docker files, or application code run the same checks without publication. Workflow artifacts have limited retention; they are not release downloads.

## Publish a release

Use the [next-release checklist](#checklist-for-your-next-release) above to preview and start publication. The following checks apply to every release.

The helper checks that fetch and push URLs both identify `Sphere10/LocalNotion`, the checkout is clean including untracked files, HEAD descends from `origin/master`, and the version does not downgrade. It refuses an existing local or remote `v<version>` tag. It updates and commits only `Version.props` when needed, creates an annotated tag, then atomically pushes HEAD to master and the tag together. Normal remote permissions and branch protection still apply; no force push is used.

The tag starts [.github/workflows/release.yml](../.github/workflows/release.yml). Its metadata job requires the tag to match `Version.props` and checks that the release commit belongs to the official default branch. Publication waits for all native and Docker checks. A manual workflow dispatch can also request publication, but only from the official repository's default branch; use the release helper for the normal version-and-tag flow.

[publish-github-release.ps1](publish-github-release.ps1) validates the nine archives and saved Docker image, then publishes matching assets and image metadata. The version is immutable: an existing published release, a changed tag, or a conflicting versioned image is rejected. Do not move a published tag or reuse its version for changed binaries.

When the release tag already exists, the publisher verifies that it points to the tested commit and uses `gh release create --verify-tag` without a separate commit target. GitHub uses `target_commitish` only to create a missing tag; an explicit historical target can also require workflow permissions that `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot receive. The existing tag, artifact metadata, and Docker revision retain the original build identity. See [GitHub's release API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release).

If publication stops while a draft exists, rerun the failed jobs in the **same workflow run**. A matching draft can resume only when version, build number, commit, image identity, and existing asset hashes agree. A fresh dispatch of the build workflow has a different build number and cannot take over that draft. The dedicated recovery workflow below instead preserves the original build identity when a publisher fix is needed. Inspect an uncertain push or publication result before retrying; the local helper retains its commit and tag after a failed atomic push.

A stable release can become latest only if it is newer than GitHub's current latest release and does not precede Docker's current latest version. An equal Docker version is accepted only for the identical image, allowing recovery after Docker promotion succeeded but GitHub publication failed. Prereleases and older stable releases retain explicit version tags without moving either latest pointer. Use the image digest in `release.json` or the workflow summary for immutable deployments.

Anonymous access to GHCR is checked before the draft is published. If organization policy prevents public packages, an owner must enable public package creation and make the package public; see the [Docker publishing and public-access guide](#public-container-registry-access). Changing version tags does not resolve package visibility restrictions.

## Public container registry access

The official image is **`ghcr.io/sphere10/local-notion`**. The release workflow publishes version tags and promotes eligible stable releases to `latest`. Package visibility is configured separately.

On first publication, GHCR creates a private package. A public source repository does not automatically make its package public. An organization owner can open [Sphere10 Packages](https://github.com/orgs/Sphere10/packages), select **local-notion**, and use **Package settings → Danger Zone → Change visibility → Public**. A package made public cannot later be made private. See [GitHub's package visibility documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility).

If **Public** is disabled, an organization owner should check **Sphere10 → Settings → Packages → Package Creation** and enable **Public**, then return to the package's visibility settings. If an enterprise policy controls that setting, its administrator must allow public packages first. This is an organization permission setting; changing the image tags or republishing the package does not grant anonymous access. See [GitHub's organization package settings](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility#package-creation-visibility-for-organization-members).

After changing visibility, verify a pull without stored registry credentials. In PowerShell, use a new empty Docker configuration directory:

```powershell
$anonymousConfig = Join-Path $env:TEMP ('local-notion-anonymous-' + [guid]::NewGuid().ToString('N'))
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $anonymousConfig | Out-Null
docker --config $anonymousConfig pull ghcr.io/sphere10/local-notion:latest
```

A successful anonymous pull confirms public access. Seeing a package while signed in does not establish that access.

## Recover publication after a publisher fix

For a transient registry or GitHub failure, first use **Re-run failed jobs** on the original release run. This keeps the original artifacts and build number. If the publisher code itself needs a fix, rerunning that job uses the old checkout; use the dedicated [Retry release publication workflow](../.github/workflows/release-retry.yml) after the fix is merged to master.

1. Open the original failed run under [Actions → Build and release Local Notion](https://github.com/Sphere10/LocalNotion/actions/workflows/release.yml). Confirm that its metadata job, all eight native jobs, and Docker job succeeded. Copy the numeric run ID from its URL: `https://github.com/Sphere10/LocalNotion/actions/runs/<run-id>`.
2. Open [Actions → Retry release publication](https://github.com/Sphere10/LocalNotion/actions/workflows/release-retry.yml), choose **Run workflow**, and select **master** so the fixed publisher is used.
3. Enter the original numeric run ID in **run_id**, then start the workflow. Supply the original tagged build's ID, not the ID of a later preview or recovery run.
4. Follow the recovery run's validation and publication steps in Actions. Its logs and summary identify the original version, build number, commit, and image. Confirm the result on the release page and in the publication summary before treating the release as complete.

The recovery workflow accepts only an original official `release.yml` run triggered by a `v<semantic-version>` tag push, with successful metadata, eight native, and Docker jobs. It downloads the nine original archives and saved tested Docker image by that run ID, and passes the original run number, source commit, and version to the current publisher. It uses the existing tag, performs the usual immutability checks, and does not rebuild binaries or create a replacement tag. The recovery workflow's own run number is not a new application build number.

Recovery uses GitHub's automatic token. It needs `actions: read` to inspect the original run and download its artifacts, plus `contents: write` and `packages: write` in the publication job. It is restricted to the official repository's default branch; the existing registry access and public-visibility requirements still apply.

Run recovery promptly: the saved Docker image is retained for **one day**, and native/launcher artifacts for **seven days**. Expired artifacts cannot be recovered by rebuilding different bytes under the same version. Both normal retries and this recovery path can resume only a matching draft; a published release, changed tag, or conflicting image/assets is refused. No new release is considered published merely because its build jobs passed.

# LocalNotion agent entrypoint

Use the [Sphere10 workspace master](<D:/Development/Sphere10/AGENTS.md>) and the centrally
registered physical Framework checkout. Keep only product facts and constraints
here; shared workflows, skills, roles and checkout state belong in the workspace.

Local Notion is a cross-platform .NET command-line application and content library that synchronizes Notion resources, renders them through Sphere10.Framework.Web.VisualRenderer, and hosts Notion-authored CMS websites.

Preserve the GPL license and existing linking exception, the MIT Sphere10.Framework.Web.VisualRenderer dependency in the selected Framework checkout, and the vendored Notion.Client provenance. The renderer uses the same Sphere10FrameworkRoot/source-package switch and exact package version as the other Framework libraries. Keep Sphere10-specific site themes outside the renderer. LocalNotion must have no Enterprise/DRM dependencies, embedded product license or license-enforced quotas. Default Framework references use clean post-extraction source at ../Framework, configurable through Sphere10FrameworkRoot; no Enterprise checkout/feed is required. Public Framework.Application 3.1.2 still bundles DRM and is rejected. Framework package mode requires an explicit separately produced clean version (3.1.3 or later); do not claim public availability or a fresh public-clone build from local-source verification. See README.md for the current availability boundary. Product source: LocalNotion.CLI/** and LocalNotion.Core/** follow Framework source scope. Product NUnit tests: tests/** follow Framework test scope. Modify Notion.Client/** only for necessary SDK capability, preserving its upstream conventions and licensing. Do not invoke sync, publish, integration tests with live credentials, or deployment scripts as a normal build check.

Build: `dotnet build LocalNotion.sln -c Release -p:BuildNumber=0 -p:BuildRevision=0`
Test: `dotnet test tests/LocalNotion.Core.Tests/LocalNotion.Core.Tests.csproj -c Release -p:BuildNumber=0 -p:BuildRevision=0`
Launch: `dotnet run --project LocalNotion.CLI/LocalNotion.CLI.csproj -c Debug -p:BuildNumber=0 -p:BuildRevision=0 -- --help`

Pass an explicit BuildNumber for local verification: otherwise Directory.Build.targets increments the tracked LOCAL-BUILD-NUMBER file. User-facing CMS documentation lives in docs/cms; the embedded blank CMS schema lives with its Core implementation. Keep their supported behavior and command examples aligned.

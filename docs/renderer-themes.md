# Embedded themes and output assets

`Sphere10.VisualRenderer` embeds the built-in theme templates, includes, configuration, and assets. Rendering does not create or populate a theme directory.

```csharp
var renderer = new HtmlRenderer(new ThemeCatalog(new ThemeOptions {
    ThemesDirectory = optionalOverrideDirectory
}));
var result = renderer.Render(document, new RenderOptions {
    Themes = ["default"],
    Environment = RenderEnvironment.Offline,
    AssetBaseUrl = "../render-assets"
});
```

Omit `ThemeCatalog` or `ThemesDirectory` to use the embedded defaults. A configured directory need not exist. LocalNotion additionally deploys missing built-in files to its configured themes path, normally `.localnotion/themes`, on repository creation and opening. Existing files are preserved. This deployment belongs to Core; the standalone renderer does not perform it.

To override one file, create the corresponding named-theme path, for example `.localnotion/themes/default/paragraph.html`. The remaining files, including `.config.json`, fall back to the assembly. Empty files count as overrides. In the standalone renderer, removing an override reveals the embedded version on the next independent render or render batch. LocalNotion also restores that missing built-in file on its next repository open. A session keeps the bytes it read, so editing files during later renders cannot change an earlier result. `HtmlRenderer` calls `ThemeCatalog.CreateSnapshot()` per render; a catalog that is already a snapshot returns itself and reuses sessions for the same ordered themes, environment, mode and asset base URL. Pass `catalog.CreateSnapshot()` to the renderer when rendering a group of documents against one consistent set of overrides. Direct `CreateSession` calls on a catalog with a mutable override directory refresh independently.

A custom theme needs its own `.config.json` and can inherit a built-in theme:

```json
{
  "type": "html",
  "base": "default",
  "tokens": {
    "BrandName": { "offline": "Example", "online": "Example" }
  }
}
```

For each named theme, disk files override the matching embedded files. The first selected theme contributes its complete base chain, applied from the oldest base through the selected theme. Each later selected theme overlays only its own files and tokens, in selection order; its base chain is not applied again. An explicitly selected base later in the list therefore overrides earlier values with its own definitions. This preserves the original renderer's cascade: decorative themes can replace their specific includes without resetting earlier carousel, column, or typography templates. File origin never outranks these theme priorities.

The existing template selection order remains: mode folder plus environment variant, mode folder generic, root generic, root environment variant. In particular, `readonly/paragraph.html` is selected before `paragraph.html`.

Missing required templates, invalid configuration, unknown themes, and inheritance/include cycles report `ThemeException`; invalid override files are not silently ignored. File names and token names use ordinal comparison. Preserve their spelling across operating systems.

Previously extracted theme copies remain ordinary overrides. They can mask newer embedded defaults and corrected built-in template references. The library never deletes or rewrites them automatically.

## Publishing the result

An `HtmlRenderResult` contains `Html` and `Assets`. Each asset has:

- `RelativePath`: a path such as `assets/{sha256}/resources/local-notion/css/ln.css`.
- `ContentType`: the media type to return when serving it.
- `Content`: the in-memory bytes of that render's resource snapshot.

The HTML's asset URLs are `AssetBaseUrl` plus those relative paths; when no base is supplied, they are relative to the rendered document. A web host can serve `Assets` from memory using their paths and content types. A static exporter can write them under its chosen output asset directory. LocalNotion's generated asset output is separate from its theme override directory.

The bundle hash covers the effective resource paths and bytes. Different overrides cannot overwrite resources used by an earlier document. Place custom assets and their relative dependencies under the theme's `resources/` tree. Each bundle preserves complete effective resource subtrees, including MathJax fonts and modules and Prism's bundled language grammars. Reuse identical bundle paths when publishing several documents.

`RenderEnvironment.Online` uses each asset's owning theme `online_url`, whether that file comes from disk or the assembly. Existing extracted theme folders and local file overrides do not disable CDN links. Inherited files retain their owning theme's URL: CMS scripts use the CMS CDN directory, while the inherited LocalNotion script uses the default theme directory. Template and include contents still prefer disk overrides. To change a remotely served asset, publish it at the configured URL or configure the theme to use your own hosted URL. Offline rendering, and assets whose owning theme has no online URL, use the emitted resource bundle and `AssetBaseUrl`.

The no-disk library contract is HTML plus in-memory resources. An offline static page requires the emitted resource files beside its output, or a host that serves the same bytes. It is not a promise of self-contained single-file HTML. External media and social embeds retain their own network requirements.
